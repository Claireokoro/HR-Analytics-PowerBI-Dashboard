## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project were to visualize and analyze HR data using Power BI. The dataset, obtained from IBM, was in CSV format and contained various attributes related to employees. The dashboard was designed to provide insights into the following key areas:

1. Attrition Rate by Department and Gender
2. Job Satisfaction Ratings by Profession and Age Brackets
3. Attrition Count Analysis
4. Job Satisfaction Ratings based on Marital Status and Tenure
5. Promotions Frequency Analysis

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Power BI: A powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool.
- IBM HR Dataset: The dataset containing employee-related information.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures for calculations.
- Microsoft 365 Developer Account: Used to publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for online interaction.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following visuals:

- Attrition Rate by Department and Gender: A visual representation of attrition rates across different departments and genders.
- Job Satisfaction Ratings by Profession and Age Brackets: Insights into job satisfaction ratings based on professions and age groups.
- Attrition Count: Visualization of attrition counts within the dataset.
